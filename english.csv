19350,Meetings in Puerto Plata,"Puerto Plata is a world-class sports event destination, well known for kiteboarding, windsurfing and surfing competitions on Cabarete Beach. Its historic center is replete with beautiful Victorian-style houses dating back to the end of the 19sup>th/sup> century, including the newly opened and restored Gregorio Luperón House-Museum. Its San Felipe fortress (from 1577) harks back to the days of the pirates in the Caribbean.

Puerto Plata isÂ nestled between the waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the majestic mountains of the northern mountain range. It is the land of Brugal Rum, and the 2,700-foot (823-meter) cable car ride to the top of Mount Isabel de Torres with its famous Botanical Gardens, statue of Christ and inspirational views of Puerto Plata and its coastline.

Combining culture with nature and fun in the sun is easy in Puerto Plata, where spouses and family members will have plenty to do.

Incentives full of authentic experiences can be organized. The North Coast is perfect for eco-enthusiasts who love to be pampered between adventures.Â  Imagine a beach rally along the more than 62 miles (100 km) of beaches.

To mesmerize your team, there is nothing better than having them conquer the challenges of the 27 Waterfalls of Damajagua. There is caving and ziplining. But there are also two great golf courses â€“ Playa Dorada and Playa Grande to be played.
